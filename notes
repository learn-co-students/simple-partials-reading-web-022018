partial
View files. helps remove repeated pieces of HTML
an underscore is prefixed to the filename to indicate that this file is a partial

ex
<!-- app/views/posts/_form.html.erb-->
<label>Post title:</label><br>
<%= text_field_tag :title %><br>
<label>Post Description</label><br>
<%= text_area_tag :description %><br>
<%= submit_tag "Submit Post" %>

<!-- app/views/posts/edit.html.erb-->
<h3>Post Form</h3>
<%= form_tag post_path(@post), method: "put" do %>
<%= render 'form' %> #<- where the magic happens to pull in partial
<% end %>

<!-- app/views/posts/new.html.erb-->
%= form_tag posts_path do %>
<%= render 'form' %> #<- where the magic happens to pull in partial
<% end %>

*even though the last line of the form (the <% end %> tag) is duplicated code, we didn't move it into the partial.
*We could have named the partial whatever we wanted to. just start with underscore

referencing a partial from a different folder   ex: <%= render 'posts/form' %>
